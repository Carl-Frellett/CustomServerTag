# CustomServerTag
Built using the Exiled framework.
This is a plugin that allows you to customize server tags, but in reality, its usefulness is quite limited. You can view your server’s tags through [kigen.co](https://kigen.co/)
## ⚠Disclaimer⚠
This plugin is inspired by EXILED’s ServerNamePatch. Please do not overinterpret; this plugin is for entertainment purposes only!
